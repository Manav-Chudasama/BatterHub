## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk (Authentication)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Mongoose (ODM)
- Cloudinary (Image Storage)
- Framer Motion (Animations)
- React Icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB database (Atlas or local)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) account for authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/batterhub.git
   cd batterhub
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.local.example` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

4. Update the `.env.local` file with your credentials:

   - MongoDB connection string
   - Clerk API keys

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## CORS Configuration

The application is configured to allow cross-origin requests to all API endpoints, making it possible for external services to access your API. This is especially important for:

- Clerk webhook integration
- External API clients
- Frontend applications hosted on different domains

CORS is enabled through three layers:

1. **Next.js Configuration**: The `next.config.ts` file includes headers configuration for all API routes.
2. **Middleware**: The `middleware.ts` file adds CORS headers to all API responses and handles OPTIONS preflight requests.
3. **Route-level Headers**: Each API route includes specific CORS headers in its responses.

This triple-layered approach ensures that CORS works correctly in all environments, including development, production, and when deployed to various hosting platforms.

## Setting Up Clerk Webhooks

BatterHub uses Clerk webhooks to synchronize user data with MongoDB. Follow these steps to set up the webhooks:

1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/).

2. Navigate to the "Webhooks" section.

3. Create a new webhook with the following settings:

   - Endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk` (use your production URL or a tunnel for local development)
   - Events to subscribe to:
     - `user.created`
     - `user.updated`
     - `user.deleted`

4. Copy the "Signing Secret" and add it to your `.env.local` file as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

5. For local development, you can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your localhost.

## Setting Up Cloudinary

BatterHub uses Cloudinary for image uploads, including listing images. Follow these steps to set up Cloudinary:

1. Create a [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) if you don't have one already.

2. Navigate to your Cloudinary Dashboard and get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret.

3. Add your Cloudinary credentials to your `.env.local` file:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

4. Restart your development server to apply the changes.

5. Cloudinary will automatically create folders for your uploaded images based on the structure specified in the code (batterhub/listings/{userId}).

## Database Models

### User Model

The User model represents a user in the BatterHub platform. It includes:

- Authentication details (linked with Clerk)
- Profile information
- Skills and interests
- Reputation and trade history
- Saved listings

When a user signs up through Clerk, a webhook is triggered that creates the user in MongoDB.
